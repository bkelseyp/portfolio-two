# Updated Portfolio [portfolio-two]
Within this repository, you'll see my updated portfolio. I hope to use Materialize, I found it easier and customizable than bootstrap. The only issue I had when using it the first time was responsiveness. 


#### Design
I considered doing a parallex scroll/ navigation website, but I don't think I have the time. 

# Pages:
index/ home- about section
work
resume

The content of your portfolio page is a lot more important than the aesthetics. That said, there are a couple basic requirements your portfolio page should meet:

* Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes

* Readability: make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
